1. Late check-in/early check-out is permitted as per policy for 2 days in a month,
   however, if this happens for more than prescribed time,
   employee will be treated as absent and he/she will have to manage this through normal leave processes if available. 
    
2. Late check-in and early check-out on same day to be treated as absent    
3. Employees get two days with grace time attendance.

confusion
   what period of time is to defined as late check-in?
   what period of time is to be defined as grace check-in?
    
    start_time : 10am
    late_in : 15 min
    grace_start_time : 12 pm
    
    after 10:15 am is defined as late check-in but to what time the late check-in counts like after 12 pm the grace_start_time starts.

    what if the employee comes at 1pm, how to treat this?

    the same scenario goes to the early check out .
